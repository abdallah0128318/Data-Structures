# Data Structures from Scratch

This repository contains implementations of various data structures written from scratch in C++. The goal is to explore and understand how these data structures work behind the scenes, without relying on built-in libraries.


## Notes

1. I wrote all my classes in a header file just to help you with online judge if you want to test the code first instead of separating it according to 'how and why concept'. in short I thinks this will give you best experience.  



## Motivation

As a software developer, it is crucial to have a solid understanding of fundamental data structures and algorithms. Writing them from scratch allows you to:
- Deepen your understanding of how they work internally.
- Optimize and adapt them to different use cases.
- Discover performance characteristics such as time and space complexity.

## Data Structures Implemented

- Singly Linked List
- Doubly Linked List
- LinkedStack: a stack using linked list
- Queue : I built queue data structure using Linked list and circular array
- Dynamic Array (Vector): here I built a dynamic array aka resizable array using dynamic memory allocation.
- Binary Search Tree
- Hash Map (Dictionary)
- Graph (Adjacency List and Matrix)
- Heap (Min and Max Heaps)
